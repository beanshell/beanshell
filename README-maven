Notes on maven restructuring

I am using maven 3.2.5, but any recent version should work.

To build the jar and run it do

mvn clean package
java -jar assembly/target/bsh-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Things to be done
- Test servlet
- Update servlet dependency
- Get javacc to work and then ignore the generated files
- Make all the doc building work
- Get the tests to work
- figure out the bsf.jar dependency and try to depend on something hosted
  somewhere
- same witht the asm module, can we depend on something already there and use
  the maven shade plugin to rename packages?
- figure out what javax-src in engine is about
- go through the build.xml to see if I missed anything
- determine if modules can be collapsed
