<name>Executable scripts under Unix</name>

You can use BeanShell for writing scripts as you would any other shell 
under Unix:

<example>
#!/usr/java/bin/java bsh.Interpreter 

print("foo");
</example>

<example>
#!/bin/sh
#! The following hack allows java to reside anywhere in the PATH.
//bin/sh -c "exec java bsh.Interpreter $0 $*"; exit

print("foo");
</example>

<h3>OSX</h3>

For OSX the path is a bit different:

<example>
#!/Library/Java/home/bin/java bsh.Interpreter.

print("foo");
</example>

On OSX /usr/bin/java is itself a shell script, which unfortunately won't
work out-of-the-box.
