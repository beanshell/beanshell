<name>Modes of Operation</name>

There are currently five basic modes of operation for running BeanShell:

<ul>
<li>Standalone scripts</li>
<li>Embedded in your application</li>
<li>Remote server mode</li>
<li>Servlet mode</li>
<li>Applet mode</li>
</ul>

We'll outline these in this and the coming sections.
<p/>

BeanShell is also integrated into a number of other tools and development
environments including the Emacs JDE and the NetBeans/Forte for Java IDE.
Please see the web site for articles and information about using BeanShell
within these third party tools.

<h2>Standalone</h2>

You can use BeanShell to run scripts from the command line or enter
statements interactively by starting the bsh.Interpreter class.
(See "Quickstart" for instructions on adding BeanShell to your classpath.)
<p/>

<example>
 java bsh.Interpreter [ filename ] [ arg ] [ ... ]  // Run a script file
</example>

There are a few options which can be passed to the Interpreter using Java
system properties:

<ul>
<li><strong>outfile</strong> - Send all output to the specified file by 
redirecting System.out and System.err</li>

<li><strong>debug</strong> - Turn on debugging output.  <em>Note: this mode
is very verbose and unstructured.  It is not intended for general
use.</em></li>

<li><strong>trace</strong></li> - Turn on method tracing.  <em>Note: this mode
is incomplete.  It should be considered experimental.</em>
</ul>

<h2>Interactive Use</h2>

One of the most popular uses for BeanShell is, of course, as a "shell" for
interactive experimentation and debugging.  BeanShell can be run in a GUI 
desktop mode that offers a number conveniences like command line history,
cut &amp; paste, and tools for interactive use such as a simple classbrowser.  
We'll talk about the GUI in "The BeanShell Desktop" later.  

<tip>
The BeanShell GUI is comprised mostly of a set of BeanShell scripts supplied 
in the JAR file and launched by the BeanShell desktop() command.
</tip>

However BeanShell can also be run interactively in plain text on the command 
line.  

<example>
 java bsh.Interpreter   // Run interactively on the command line
</example>

This is useful for quick "one liners"; however it does not offer 
creature comforts such as command line history and editing.  We should note
that some shells, such as the Windows environment, do command line history 
and editing automatically - providing these features for BeanShell.

<h2>The .bshrc Init File</h2>

When run interactively, BeanShell looks for a startup file called ".bshrc"
in the user's home directory.  If the file is found it is sourced into the
interactive shell.  You can use this to perform setup for your interactive
use.  For example, to add additional default imports or to toggle on the
show() command if you prefer that.
<p/>

The location of the .bshrc file is determined by the Java system property
"user.home", which has different locations under different operating systems.
The following table lists common locations:

<h3>.bshrc File Location:</h3>
