<h2>Adding Commands to BeanShell</h2>
<p/>

Adding to the set of "prefab" commands supplied with bsh can be about as easy as
writing any other bsh methods.  You simply have to place your bsh scripts
in a bsh/commands/ directory in the classpath (or inside the JAR file).
<p/>
You can also implement bsh commands directly in Java as .class files which 
are dynamically loaded when needed.    The dir() commands are an example
of a bsh command that is implemented in Java.  (I did this originaly for 
speed).
