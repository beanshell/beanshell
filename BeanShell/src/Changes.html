<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2>Changes in 1.2b6 </h2>
<pre>
	- Fixed accessibility bug in finding fields
	- Fixed minor bugs in bsh.servlet.BshServlet
	- Modified scoping on for-loop and catch blocks such that untyped variables
	in the for-init and catch parameter (respectively) do not leak out of
	the block.   They now act as you would expect in normal Java.
	- Fixed some thread safety bugs with try/catch blocks.
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.2b5 </h2>
<pre>
	- Fixed bug in using loosely typed vars as indexes to arrays.
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.2b43 </h2>
<pre>
	- Modified Interpreter so that it is serializable.  It is now possible
	to serialize the entire bsh instance.  The load() and save() commands
	however recognize when you are trying to save a bsh object (bsh.This)
	type and detach it from the parent namespace, so that saving a bsh object
	in this way doesn't drag along the whole interpreter  See This.bind()
	and This.unbind().
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.2b42 </h2>
<pre>
	- Fixed bug affecting scoping in blocks.  This was breaking the test 
	harness in a way that caused it not to be caught before!
	- Added a special test for the test harness to catch this sort of thing
	in the future.
	- Fixed problem with classloading causing bsh extensions not to be found
	in some environments.
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.2b3 and 1.2b4 </h2>
<pre>
	- The class manager now uses the Thread "context classloader" to factory
	classes when available.  This allows bsh to be instaled in the 
	jre/lib/ext directory (previously user classes wouldn't be seen).  Yeah!
	This may also allow bsh to see user classpath in application servers
	like Weblogic, which include it in the core classpath.
	- added the clear() command to clear variables and methods from a namespace.
	- added setOut() and setErr() methods to Interpreter.
	- added new bsh.servlet package to the main distribution
	- added bsh.Remote launcher
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.2b2 and 1.2b3 </h2>
<pre>
	- Fixed nasty bug in grammar, added test cases to expression.bsh
	Note: this bug was preventing the latest version of bsh from being used
	with Weblogic 6.1 (which uses bsh internally and was failing).
	- Handled the "single line comment with no terminating linefeed" issue.
	- Added getInterface() method to Interpreter.
	- Fixed issue with identity semantics for this in cast case, e.g.:
		((ActionListener)this == (ActionListener)this) is now true.
	- cat() command will now print files, urls, streams, and readers
	- Exceptions in native (compiled) user classes will now print with
		both the BeanShell script trace and native Java stack trace.  
		Exceptions generated directly from scripts continue to show only the 
		script trace (as that is all that is meaningful).  
	- ParseException is now a subtype of EvalError... previously these were
		caught and the contents were moved to an EvalError.  This means that 
		now the ParseEx implements the contract as far as getErrorLineNumber(),
		getErrorText(), and getErrorSourceFile()
	- In interactive mode, the last uncaught exception is now available in
		the variable $_e (like the $_ last result).
	- Improved the way that imported class names are cached in namespaces,
		reducing the number of caches created and improving performance.
	- Improved javap() command slightly
	- Modified This references so that you can invoke the methods: getClass()
		and invokeMethod() on them.
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.2b1</h2>
<pre>
	- Added support for accessibility - Using a dynamically loaded extension
	(ReflectManager) bsh will use the accessibility API to allow access to
	private/protected fields, methods and non-public classes.
	- added the setAccessible() command to turn this behavior on/off
	(it is *off* by default in this release...  we may change that later.)
	- added the bsh.reflect package and ReflectManager to support the above.
	- Added support for IBM's Bean Scripting Framework (BSF). 
	- Added a new jar with the BSF adapter class bsh.util.BeanShellBSFEngine.
	This is also included in the full dist (it's small).
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha19</h2>
<pre>
	- Added a somewhat experimental "strict java" mode.  When activated with
	setStrictJava(true) BeanShell will:
		1) require typed variable declarations, method arguments and 
			return types
		2) modify the scoping of variables to look for the variable declaration
			first in the parent namespace, as in a java method inside a java
			class.  e.g. if you can write a method called incrementFoo() that
			will do the correct thing without referring to super.foo.

	-Added another form of the run() command that accepts an argument to be
		passed to the child context.
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha18</h2>
<pre>
    - Fixed a bug affecting static field access.
    - Added a static setClassLoader() method to Interpreter and BshClassManager.
        This allows an external classloader to be specified.
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha17</h2>
<pre>
    - Added simple mechanism to allow scripted commands/methods to accept
      class identifiers as arguments. e.g.:
        foo( java.lang.String );
      see Name.identifierToClass();
    - added which() command - shows class source
    - modified class browser to show class source when class is selected
    - Changed the type of the (very recently added) this.callstack reference
        from an array to the actual internal CallStack type.  You can use
        toArray() to get it as an array or get(depth).
    - added unset() method to interpreter.  Fixed bug in set(name, null);
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha16</h2>
<pre>
    Improved error reporting on errors during method invocation.
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha15</h2>
<pre>
    - Fixed server mode and re-added demo applets
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha14</h2>
<pre>
    - Important addition - nodes now remember the source file from which
    they were parsed...  This means that debug messages are much more useful
    now, especially with errors thrown from multiple files.
    - Re-worked classpath mapping user feedback mechanism (will support a GUI
    now).
    - Fixed general block scoping bugs.  Things should act like Java now.
    typed vars declared within blocks does not leak out.  e.g. { int i=2; } 
    - Added getSourceFileInfo() command to return the name of the file or
    source from which the current interpreter is reading.  
    (uses this.interpreter.getSourceFileInfo())
    - Added a parent ref to the interpreter for future use by the child
    eval interpreters.
    - Added new form of source() command that takes a URL.
    - Tenatively added new feature to get the text of a method invocation 
    from within the method body...  may be useful along with this.caller.
    See namespace.getInovcationText() namespace.getInvocationLine().
</pre>
<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha13</h2>
<pre>
    - Removed core bsh package dependencies on 1.2.  bsh will now compile and
        run under 1.2  with some features limited.
    - Moved some console related functionality out of the core and into 
        bsh.util.  There is a new bsh.util.GUIConsoleInterface.  NameCompletion
        is now in bsh.util and has been replaced with a more primitive 
        supporting interface bsh.NameSource in the core.
</pre>
<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha13</h2>
<pre>
    - Moved all Name object construction into NameSpace.  This will support
    Name resolvers caching information in the future. e.g. bsh could
    know that a variable is final and optimize the resolution.  Or a long
    chain of names (java.lang.Integer.MAX_INTEGER) could be optimized.
    - .class on array types now working. e.g.  "int [][].class"
    - Fixed bugs in grammar which dissallowed certain simple expressions
    unless they were parenthesized.
    - Fixed related case relating to expressions with assignment to a 
    throw-away method invocation.
</pre>


<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha12</h2>
<pre>
    - Added "trace" option.
        java -Dtrace=true bsh.Interpreter or trace() command.
        turns on printing of each line before it is executed.  Note that
        this currently prints only top level lines as they are parsed and
        executed by the interpreter.  trace skips over method exectutions 
        (including bsh commands) etc.  We may enhance this in the future.
    - Fixed bugs in primitive handling:
        primitives smaller than int are now properly assigned in declarations:
            e.g.: byte b = 5;
        primitive are internally promoted to the correct type on assignment
        to a typed variable, 
            e.g.:  long l = (byte)5;  // l is a long value internally
    - Cleanup in cast operation.. re-factored the cast code into two types
        of cast operations.
    - Tightened up re-declaration of typed variables...  You can only redeclare
        a typed var with the same type, else you can an error.  Previously
        there was odd behavior where you could redeclare with an assignable
        type.
    - Fixed bugs in casting
    - Fixed the remainng known bugs in array initializers.  They should now
    work precisely as they do in Java.  See the test case for examples.
</pre>
<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha11</h2>
<pre>
    - Improved error reporting.  There should no longer be any errors that
        report "unknown location".  At minimum, any error should report the
        source file and line number.  Normally errors should report the text
        of the offending construct.
    - Cleanup in array handling
        - fixed bugs with null initializers, loose types, promotion
</pre>
<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha10</h2>
<pre>
    - Major internal change: added callstack.
        two new magic references:
            bsh.This this.caller
            NameSpace [] this.callstack
    - Some commands now behave correctly, some slight changes- see notes.

    - made change to insure that pathToFile always returns canonical path
    this fixed bug in addClassPath
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha9</h2>
<pre>
    - Added a very nice ANT build file, yeah!
    - added a bit more synchronization in console
    - removed unecessary file/cwd related code
    - removed unecessary code and lib file supporting old java packages 
        optimization

    - Redefined scoping behavior in for-init to act like java.  See notes
    elsewhere.
    - Added switch statement.
    - made sure Ctrl-d in interctive mode shuts down interpreter.
    - Fixed cleanup of weak references in bsh class manager
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha8</h2>
<pre>
    - import changes -
        - Defined order of precedence - in bsh ambiguous imports are compile 
        time error.  In bsh (where imports are allowed at any time) the later 
        import takes precedence.
        - fixed bug causing stack overflow

    - Internal restructuring - made Interpreter its own class rather than being
        auto-generated by javacc.  This allows us to generate decent javadoc 
        without hundreds of parser methods.  Improved javadoc.

    - Fixed the precedence of name resolution to be consisten with Java.
        variables now always trump class name resolution.  This simplifies
        name resolution a bit and also makes things a bit faster.  However 
        sometimes you have to use import now to get around a variable name 
        hiding a qualified class name.

    - Performance improvement: empty loop test case four times faster
        overall appears as much as 30% faster
    - Fixed bugs in certain runtime exception handling
    - Fixed bug in static vs. dynamic overloaded method resolution
</pre>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha6</h2>
<pre>
    - Fixed grammar relating to Expression/BlockStatement parsing...  This was 
    causing the bug with declaring a typed var with a fully qualified class 
    name.  e.g. java.sql.Date date;

    - Fixed 'return' control problem...  return now works properly for 
    interactive and non-interactive scripts.

    F- ixed CTRL-D bug - now exits properly in interactive mode.
</pre>

<h2>
<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha51</h2>
<pre>
    - Fixed bug causing debug code to call toString() for every method call on
    an object, whether debug was on or not.
</pre>
</h2>

<h2>Changes in 1.1alpha5</h2>
<pre>
    - License change only...  Added SPL Sun Public License agreement with
    dual licensing under the LGPL
</pre>

<h2>Changes in bsh1.1alpha3</h2>
<pre>
    - Added .field style properties access in addition to the {} style
    - Added anonymous inner class style allocation for interfaces
    - Class browser now reflects changes in class path
</pre>

<h2>Changes in bsh1.1alpha2</h2>
<pre>
    - Added namespace based name completion for console and classbrowser
        completes variables, classes, (coming... bsh methods)

    - Added import * capability to read full classpath.
    - Added overloading of bsh scripted methods
    - Added classpath extension and class reloading
        reloadClasses() reloadClasses(item)

    - improved the class browser - now has tree for packages and reflects
    the extended classpath , other improvements

    - Loose arguments in catch clauses now work.
    - deprecated getVariable/setVariable api.  Moving to get()/set()/eval();
    - internally removed BshVariable - it wasn't doing what it was historically
    intended for.  Replaced with a new bsh.system object which is shared
    across all interpreter instances
    - Added bsh.system.shutdownOnExit variable... set to false to prevent
    exit() command and desktop close from exiting the VM.
    - Loosened grammar to allow import statments in any block scope.
    e.g. you can now import within a bsh method and the import will be local
    to that method
    -Added javap() command...  accepts object, class, or string name and
    prints public fields, methods

    -Added -Doutfile=foo capture output to file (for Windows nightmare)
    - Cleaned up a lot of internal structure in NameSpace, etc.
    -Interpreter now implements ConsoleInterface
</pre>

<h2>Changes in bsh-1.01</h2>
<pre>
    - Modified parse exceptions to print more tersely...   
    Removed the "Was expecting one of..." text *except* when debug is on.
    - Fixed the for statement forinit scope bug.
    - Got rid of remaining deprecation (using Readers vs. InputStreams)
    - Fixed top level expression bug #111342
    - Fixed problems with compiling bsh under limited JDK verions (1.1, 1.2).
      We now have factories insulating the core from all extended version
      capabilities (e.g. proxy mechanism stuff, accessibility TBD)
    - Modified browseClass() command to accept string class name, 
        class instance, or arbitrary object 
    - Modified search for constructors to accomodate package and private
        access.
    - Added close button to class browser.
</pre>

<h2>Changes in bsh-1.0</h2>
<em>Not necessarily in order of importance</em>
<p>
<ul>

<li>Added generalized support for scripts implementing interfaces (e.g.
arbitrary event listeners).
This uses the important new JDK1.3 reflection proxy mechanism to manufacture
a proxy interface at run time.  No code generation is necessary!
<ul>
    <li>Added support to the cast operation to use the new mechanism.
    <li>Added support for automatic conversion to interface on method selection.
    e.g. if you attempt to pass a bsh scripted object as a method argument
    where the method signature calls for an interface an automatic cast to
    the appropriate interface type will be attempted.
    <li>Added a magic method invoke(method,args) which can be used to 
    handle method invocations on undefined interface methods in bsh objects.  
    This takes the place of "dummy" adapters; allowing a script to ignore one 
    or more methods of an interface that it is implementing. 
    <em>Note: one special case - direct invocations within scope 
    (e.g. command invocations) are not currently sent to invoke.</em>
</ul>

<li> Added startup file (.rc file) support.
Bsh will source the file "user.home"/.bshrc upon startup.
This defaults to C:\Windows under win98 and $HOME under Unix.
(can the home be set with an env var under Win?  "home" doesn't seem to do it).

<li>Added arguments to file invocation on command line.  
e.g.
<pre>
    java bsh.Interpreter MyClass foo bar
</pre>
Args are accessible through the root bsh object:  String [] bsh.args

<li>Enhancements to JConsole submitted by Daniel Leuck;
Added color and image support, fixed several bugs.

<li>Added support for inner classes.  This should all work as expected, but
it's new so let me know if you find weirdness.
<ul>
    <li>Added support for inner classes to import statement.
</ul>

<li>Changed the way eval()/source() handle script errors.  Instead of 
returning the error object as a value it is now wrapped up with some context 
and rethrown as an EvalError.  So you can simply catch the error with a normal 
try/catch block if you want to.  Previously errors in sourced/eval'd files 
were being squelched.  This was bad.  Note: exceptions generated by the
script or through code called by the script are thrown as TargetErrors (a
subclass of EvalError) which can also be caught and examined.


<li>Improved error reporting in many areas.  
Fixed really annoying error reporting bug that squelched target error 
info in sourced files (and commands).

<li>Improved bsh cast operation so that it throws standard ClassCastException 
for invalid cast.  You can now guard against them with the ordinary try/catch
in a bsh script.

<li>Modified the command line portion of the grammar to accept arbitrary 
expressions. e.g. you can type ``5*2;'' or ``foo instanceof Foo;'' on the 
command line now without any enclosing parens.
(Of course you won't see anything unless you're using the show() option).

<li>Removed the old AWT version of the GUI console.  If you need it you can 
get it on the web site separately.  I may reconsider this.

<li>Removed the console() command which was primarily for the old AWT console.

<li>Modified the browseClass() command to take an object instead of a string
class name.  Now you can simple say browseClass( someObject ) and pop up
the class browser to the correct place.  Special hack: If the specified object 
is a Class it will use the class.  This will all probably be replaced by
a general browse() method for the upcoming object inspector.

<li>Changed the return type of the frame() command to allow it to return an
internal frame when desktop is active.  Frame will now do the correct thing
whether the desktop is up or not.

<li>Rebuilt the distribution with JavaCC / JJTree version 1.1.  
Haven't notice any difference yet.

<li>Fixed the 'for' scoping bug - See docs on for scoping for clarification.
Previously variables declared within the for-init section were leaking out
into the outer namespace. 

<li>Fixed a bug in which tokenizer errors would cause the interpreter to hang
or exit.  They are now handled like other parsing errors.  In the future we
may want to break them out so that they can be handled separately from
EvalError.

<li>Added missing += form of string concatenation.

<li>Incorporated a patch and test suite case from Roger Bolsius that corrects 
some of the package / hidden reflected class access.  Previously the code did 
not handle the more difficult cases.

<li>Incorporated a patch from Mike Woolley which works around JDK bug 4071281
(EOF problem) under Windows JDK v1.1.

<li>Fixed most of the bugs in server mode.  Run the server pair (httpd / 
sessiond) using the server( port ) command.  Then you can telnet to port+1
or attach your web browser to port.  Note that the web browser must support
swing to run the remote JConsole.  We could supply the AWTConsole back for
compatability with old browsers...  but I'd like to move on.

<li>Internall trivia - changed the prefix of the names of all of the parser 
node classes from AST to BSH.

<li>Fixed a bug which caused ClassCastException during (ironically) a bsh 
cast operation.

<li>Improved the test harness slightly and added a number of new files to the
test suite for all of the new features.  Please send more test cases for
the test suite!

<li>Internal change: Simplified the code that determines array base types.

<li> Fixed bug where special characters on input (e.g. control charcters ^D) 
would cause the tokenizer to loop on errors.  Non printable chars are now
skipped as white space.

<li>Added the missing do-while statement

<li>Internal: Tightened up the code a bit by combining the BSH node conditional 
evaluation into one place.

<li>Fixed some race conditions in the JConsole.
Fixed multi-writer console problems.

<li>Fixed order of evaluation bugs: classes now always first, then bsh vars.
Note: this may not always be desireable.  e.g. if you have a class named
"x" in your path (violating the common naming conventions) then you can't
use a variable of name 'x' in your scripts.  Conversely though, it prevents
one from doing "Integer = 5;" and shadowing the java.lang.Integer class
with a variable name.  Any thoughts on this?

<li>Corrected handling of the bsh root object.

<li>Added a menu item to console to redirect stdin/stdout/stderr.
If you close the console they are restored to the original System.in,out,err.

</ul>
