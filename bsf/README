This is the BeanShell adapter for IBM's Bean Scripting Famework.
It is an implementation of the BSFEngine class, allowing BSF aware
applications to use BeanShell as a scripting language.

I believe this implementation is complete (with some hesitation about the
the usefullness of the compileXXX() style methods - provided by the base
utility class).


Note:

Changed over to Apache Jakarta BSF 2.3 with BeanShell 1.3.
The changes are package name changes only.
See http://www.beanshell.org/manual/bsf.html for some more info.
