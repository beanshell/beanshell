# BeanShell

## 2016-02-18 Security update

**Note**: A _security vulnerability_ has been identified in BeanShell that could be
exploited for _remote code execution_ in applications that has
BeanShell on its classpath. The vulnerability has been
fixed in the security update [BeanShell 2.0b6](https://github.com/beanshell/bean
shell/releases/tag/2.0b6). This is a **recommended update** for all BeanShell users.


## Introduction

BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable Java source interpreter with object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell dynamically executes standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences such as loose types, commands, and method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript.

You can use BeanShell interactively for Java experimentation and debugging as well as to extend your applications in new ways. Scripting Java lends itself to a wide variety of applications including rapid prototyping, user scripting extension, rules engines, configuration, testing, dynamic deployment, embedded systems, and even Java education.

BeanShell is small and embeddable, so you can call BeanShell from your Java applications to execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide extensibility in your applications. Alternatively, you can use standalone BeanShell scripts to manipulate Java applications; working with Java objects and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written in Java and runs in the same VM as your application, you can freely pass references to "live" objects into scripts and return them as results.

## Download

### Source code

The source code releases can be downloaded from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell/releases)
or [Bintray](https://bintray.com/beanshell/Beanshell/bsh/view).

Latest release: 

 - [BeanShell 2.0b6](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell/releases/tag/2.0b6) - [bsh-2.0b6-src.zip](http://dl.bintray.com/beanshell/Beanshell/org/apache-extras/beanshell/bsh/2.0b6/bsh-2.0b6-src.zip)


### Maven

Beanshell releases are published to [Maven Central](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/apache-extras/beanshell/bsh/). To use Beanshell with Maven, add to to your `pom.xml`: 

```xml
    <dependencies>
       <dependency>
         <groupId>org.apache-extras.beanshell</groupId>
         <artifactId>bsh</artifactId>
         <version>2.0b6</version>
       </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

Alternatively you can use 
[our BinTray Maven repository](http://dl.bintray.com/beanshell/Beanshell) or
[JCenter](http://jcenter.bintray.com/org/apache-extras/beanshell/bsh/2.0b6/):

```xml
<!-- just beanshell -->
<repository>
  <id>bintray-beanshell-Beanshell</id>
  <name>bintray</name>
  <url>http://dl.bintray.com/beanshell/Beanshell</url>

```

### JAR binary

You can also download the `bsh.jar` binary from Bintray. 

- [bsh-2.06b.jar](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/beanshell/Beanshell/org/apache-extras/beanshell/bsh/2.0b6/bsh-2.0b6.jar)

If you want to execute the Beanshell [User Interface](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell/wiki/Desktop), either double-click the JAR file, or run it with: 

    java -jar bsh-2.0b6.jar 

You will need [Java](http://java.com/) 5 or later installed. 

**Note**: There is a race-condition bug #4 that sometimes prevent the GUI from starting on Java 8.

 - Can work in security constrained environments without a classloader or bytecode generation for most features.
 - The interpreter is small, ~400K jar file.
 - Pure Java.
 - It's Free!!

### BeanShell Uses

- Interactive Java - try out object features, APIs and GUI widgets - "hands on".
- Scripting extension for applications - Allow your applications to be extended via scripts in an intuitive and simple way.
- Macro Languages - Generate scripts as macros and execute them live in your VM easily.

# History

## 2000: beanshell.org

BeanShell was originally maintained by Patrick Niemeyer at http://beanshell.org/ - distributed as 
BeanShell (2.0b4 and earlier) were distributed under 
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and Sun Public License (SPL).

## 2012: Move to apache-extras.org

BeanShell was [proposed as an incubator project](https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/BeanShellProposal) to
move to [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/). In preparation for this, the codebase
for BeanShell 2.0b4 was donated to ASF by a code grant, and the license changed to 
[Apache License, version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The source code was moved to http://apache-extras.org/ - a project home hosted by Google Code, that was only informerly associated with Apache Software Foundation. Many of the BeanShell committers were Apache committers, and thus Apache Extras seemed a natural home.

However the project did not to move into the [Apache incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/), and remained at apache-extras.org as an independent project.

In March 2015 Google announced it would discontinue Google Code, which provided the hosting for Apache Extras.

## 2015: Moved to github.com

On 2015-09-23, the BeanShell repository moved from https://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/p/beanshell/ to its new home on https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell/ as Google Code has been discontinued.

The project adapted an open collaboraive approach using [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell/pulls) and has since grown its committer base beyond the original Apache Extra team.

http://beanshell.org/ remains available for older versions.
