<h2>BeanShell Remote Session</h2>
<p>
Please choose the type of console applet you wish to use.
If you wish to skip this step in the future simply refer directly to one of
the links below.
<p>

<h3>Swing JConsole</h3>
To use the Swing enabled JConsole with the Java plug-in (or other swing
capable browser) choose this link:
<p>

<a href="/remote/jconsole.html">http://yourserver:port/remote/jconsole.html</a>
<p>

<h3>AWT Console</h3>
To use the minimal (not very good) AWT based console that should work in any
browser choose this link:
<p>

<a href="/remote/awtconsole.html">
http://yourserver:port/remote/awtconsole.html</a>
<p>

<h3>Telnet</h3>

If niether console works you may use telnet to connect to the remote bsh
server.  The bsh telnet session server (which is used by the console applet)
runs on the port number you specified +1 (add one to the port number of the
http bsh server you specified).  
<em>Note that this shell is not as friendly and you will have to type ";"
at the end of every line</em>
