    TargetError is an EvalError that wraps an exception thrown by the script
    (or by code called from the script).  TargetErrors indicate exceptions
    which can be caught within the script itself, whereas a general EvalError
    indicates that the script cannot be evaluated further for some reason.

    If the exception is caught within the script it is automatically unwrapped,
    so the code looks like normal Java code.  If the TargetError is thrown
    from the eval() or interpreter.eval() method it may be caught and unwrapped
    to determine what exception was thrown.
