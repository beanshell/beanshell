 EvalException indicates that the script has encountered a
 runtime exception and the current node cannot be successfully
 evaluated.

 EvalException may be thrown for a script syntax error, an evaluation
 error such as referring to an undefined variable.  Errors such as this
 mean that the current node cannot continue, but the interpreter is
 still ok.

 Exceptions where the interpreter has been corrupted or where execution
 cannot continue are handled by {@link EvalError}.
