        Disallowing VOIDs here was an easy way to support the throwing of a
        more descriptive error message on use of an undefined argument to a
        method call (very common).  If it ever turns out that we need to
        support that for some reason we'll have to re-evaluate how we get
        "meta-information" about the arguments in the various invoke() methods
        that take Object [].  We could either pass BSHArguments down to
        overloaded forms of the methods or throw an exception subtype
        including the argument position back up, where the error message would
        be compounded.
