	This interface supports name completion, which is used primarily for

	space.  For example all of the classes in the classpath or all of the
	variables in a namespace (or all of those).
	<p>
	NameSource is the lightest weight mechanism for sources which wish to
	support name completion.  In the future it might be better for NameSpace
	to implement NameCompletion directly in a more native and efficient
	fasion.  However in general name competion is used for human interaction
	and therefore does not require high performance.
